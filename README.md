# 3D Image Hover Effect 🎨✨

This project creates a **stunning 3D hover effect** on images using **HTML & CSS**. When you hover over an image, it **pops out**, while its neighboring images **tilt and fade**, creating a **smooth depth effect**.

## 🔥 Features.
- 🎭 **3D Perspective:** Uses `perspective` and `translateZ` for a depth effect.
- 🎨 **Smooth Hover Animations:** Hovering over an image makes it pop out.
- 🌟 **Sibling Effects:** Nearby images tilt and fade for a dynamic look.
- 🌎 **Fully Responsive:** Works on different screen sizes.
- ⚡ **No JavaScript Needed!** Pure **HTML + CSS** only.

- 🛠️ How It Works
The hovered image pops forward with translateZ(250px) scale(1.1).
The next & previous images tilt and fade slightly using rotateY() & filter: brightness().
The effect cascades for a realistic 3D feel.
